# InfiniteCanvas.tools

[![Screenshot of website](/readme_screenshot.jpg)](https://infinitecanvas.tools/)

[infinitecanvas.tools](https://infinitecanvas.tools/) is a microsite describing
and documenting the history of infinite canvas software, from early design tools
(e.g. Illustrator) up to the explosion of whiteboarding, design, programming,
and thinking tools today (e.g. Miro, Figma, Origami Studio, MindNode).

The site was created by the [Muse](https://museapp.com/) team to help showcase
the diversity of apps in this space. We draw some inspiration from early
versions of jamstack.org, separating advocacy for the category from any one
specific product.

We hope to celebrate how these new tools, Muse included, stand on the shoulders
of those that came before. This site is a resource and community of like minded
thinkers and builders who use infinite canvases in their work.
