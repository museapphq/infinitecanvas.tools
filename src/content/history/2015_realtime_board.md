RealtimeBoard started in 2011 to solve the needs of a distributed design agency.
By 2015, it relaunched with a new user experience and new stack (HTML5 instead
of flash) to much praise. The product accumulated momentum in tandem with the
growth of remote collaboration.

In 2019, the company was renamed Miro as part of a wider rebrand. Miro is now
considered one of the leading players in the remote collaboration software
space.
