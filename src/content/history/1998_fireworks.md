Combining both raster and vector editing, Macromedia’s Fireworks was a graphics
tool made specifically for web design. With support for interactivity, asset
export, and more, it is seen as a predecessor to modern design tools like Sketch
and Figma.

In 2005, Adobe purchased Macromedia and Fireworks was renamed Adobe Fireworks.
Seven years later, Adobe announced that it would discontinue its development.
