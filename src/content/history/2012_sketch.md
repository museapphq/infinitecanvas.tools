The first version of Sketch was released to the public in late 2010 by the Dutch
company Bohemian Coding (later renamed Sketch B.V.). It started as a vector
image editing tool but soon found traction as a design tool. Adobe’s abandonment
of Fireworks in 2012 and Sketch’s design-focused features like Symbols further
cemented it as a favorite among design teams.
