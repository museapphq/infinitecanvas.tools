Dr. Spencer Silver, while attempting to develop a super-strong adhesive,
accidentally created a "low-tack", reusable, pressurive-sensitive adhesive. He
tried to find an application for the adhesive for years. Then, his colleageu Art
Fry used the adhesive to anchor a bookmark in his hymn book. The pale yellow
color was selected by chance. After many iterations, the product was finally
sold as "Post-Its" in 1979.
