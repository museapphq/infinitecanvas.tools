Figma began in 2012 as a browser-based photo editing tool harnessing the
newly-released WebGL APIs. By 2016, Figma had launched to the public as a
browser-based interface tool much like Sketch.

Given it was built in the cloud, it sidestepped the issue of file version
control and enabled cross-platform real-time collaboration.

Over the years, Figma became one of the primary tools used by digital designers.

In 2022, Adobe announced its intention to acquire Figma for $20 billion.
However, in 2023, the merger was abandoned.
