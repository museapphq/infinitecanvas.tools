As part of his Ph.D. thesis at MIT, Ivan Sutherland, developed the earliest
instance of an infinite canvas in software, using a light pen on a CRT connected
to a Lincoln TX-2 computer.

It was the first interactive graphics program, using the first object-oriented
software system which was implemented in the first non-procedural programming
language.
