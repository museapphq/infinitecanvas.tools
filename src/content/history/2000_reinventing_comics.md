_Reinventing Comics_ is the thematic sequel to Scott McCloud's _Understanding
Comics_. The book is divided into twelve potential revolutions in how people
create, read and perceive comics.

The last of these revolutions is what McCloud called "The Infinite Canvas." This
concept breaks from the sequential flow of comics by embracing computing
technology. Instead of the computer monitor representing a page, it would
represent a window onto an endless canvas that continues in all directions.
Comics could flow non-linearly in arbitrary directions.
